# Relacy
Interface to create databses using e-pathy

gcc -o relacy relacy.c

http comunication from browser at localhost:8086

How it works:
- compile and start e-pathy.
- compile and start relacy.
- using a browser write the url: http://localhost:8086/

No other server needed, relacy has already a backend-framework integrated.
Write in the form your nodes separated by space, navigate into the nodes, and create other nodes in nodes.
